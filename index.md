# Making cool robots to solve real-world problems

The IRL is an academic research laboratory at at NJIT that focusses on developing real-world, novel robotic systems.
Key to developing these robots is the question of "so what." Why develop robots that are able to build bridges out of their own bodies? Why look at ways that robots can adapt their configuration based on unexpected environments? 
Ultimately: we want these robots to to improve the lives of people across the world.
Our work aims to establish a blueprint for how robots can be used to to address these real-world issues.

If this sounds interesting to you and you'd like to work in this lab, email petras.swissler@njit.edu or click the button above. 
The New Jersey Institute of Technology is an R1 public research university located about 30 minutes by train from Manhattan and provides ample opportunities for students to apply themselves and explore robotics.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
Our focus is the full-stack development of robotic systems. This includes everything from conceptualizing new robot mechanisms, to the building and design of robotic systems, to the development of algorithms that these new robots can use.
