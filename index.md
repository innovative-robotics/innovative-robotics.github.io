# Highlights

{% capture text %}
A big focus of our lab's work is the full-stack development of robotic systems. This includes everything from conceptualizing new robot mechanisms, to the building and design of robotic systems, to the development of algorithms that these new robots can use.

The lab has access to state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment thanks to the expansive NJIT maker space. We are also in the process of building up our own lab space, which we expect to have up and running by late 2022.
